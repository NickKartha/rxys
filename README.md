Tired of stochastic gradient descent in SVD-like algorithms, we turn to more interesting ideas like Hybrid systems, Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Implicit Feedback. Perhaps, ARIMA and LSTM ensembled with Fast R-CNN in a large stacknet. In this project, however, we use a concept from Swarm Intelligence known as PSO to optimize suggestions given to us by what once was a multi-context text generator.

This project is related to https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise and has implementations like Amazon Product Recommendations, Facebook Friend Suggestions and Book Suggestions as in https://github.com/dorukkilitcioglu/books2rec

Please read the docs for more on the available implementations. (docs will be made available shortly)
