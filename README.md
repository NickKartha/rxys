Tired of stochastic gradient descent in SVD-like algorithms, we turn to more interesting ideas like Hybrid systems, Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Implicit Feedback. Perhaps, ARIMA and LSTM ensembled with Fast R-CNN in a large stacknet. In this project, however, we use a concept from Swarm Intelligence known as PSO to optimize suggestions given to us by what once was a multi-context text generator.
